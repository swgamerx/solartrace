# Solartrace

An open community project that utilizes crowd sourcing to trace areas that a business could
install solar panels on. Using local utility sale prices of electricity and estimated Kwh 
production we then figure out an estimate on how much money those traced areas could be
making for their owners. All of these numbers are transparent and easily accessible to 
facilitate the public presentation of these estimates to the companies.
