# Solar Trace

An open community project that utilizes crowd sourcing to trace areas that a business could
install solar panels on. Using local utility sale prices of electricity and estimated Kwh 
production we then figure out an estimate on how much money those traced areas could be
making for their owners. All of these numbers are transparent and easily accessible to 
facilitate the public presentation of these estimates to the companies. 

## Questions that need answered
It is estimated that it will take 11,200,000 Acres of land to convert just the US to solar,
where are all of those solar panels going to go?

## Goals

* Produce a map of specific areas in which solar panels can be installed. 
* Present financial analytics of solar production.
* Be a transparent source of solar energy information.
* Generate social pressure by showing the financial and enviromental benefits of solar.
